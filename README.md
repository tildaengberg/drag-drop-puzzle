# Drag and drop puzzle

## Objectives
The objective of the game is to arrange a set of jumbled tiles to form a complete image. The game has a simple user interface that allows the player to drag and drop the tiles into the correct position.

## Functionally
The game randomly shuffles the tiles on the game board every time it is played. It also keeps track of the number of moves and time taken to complete the puzzle. Once the player successfully arranges the tiles in the correct order, a congratulatory message is displayed, along with the number of moves and time taken. Players can restart the game by clicking the "restart" button. The code then defines several functions, including a function to randomize the board and set it up by adding the cards to the rack and board containers. The code also includes a function to check if the puzzle is solved, a function to display the time taken, and event listener functions for each move of the pieces.
